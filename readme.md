# Switcheo Code Challenge #1 #

## Applicant information ##

I am Chan Chor Cheng, Y3 Mathematical and Computer Sciences Student in NTU Singapore, applying for the role of Full-stack intern in Switcheo. 

I do not have any blockchain background, hence found problems 4 and 5 most challenging. I tried my best in researching how to interact with the blockchain and write and deploy contracts, but still was unable to find a working solution. Despite this, I hope that I would be able to learn more about the blockchain through Switcheo, thank you for this code challenge!

## Overview ## 
Problems attempted are Problem 1, 2, 4, 5 and 7.

## Notes on some problems within the code challenge ##


### Problem 2 ###

To run, navigate to directory "problem2" and enter the following command to the terminal.
<pre><code>open index.html</code></pre>

### Problem 4 ###

To run, navigate to directory "problem4" and enter the following command to the terminal.
<pre><code>ts-node ./retrieve-holders.ts</code></pre>

** An error will be thrown when executing this code as I was unable to access the "balanceOf" function after instantiating the contract. 

### Problem 5 ###

To run, navigate to directory "problem5" and enter the following command to the terminal.
<pre><code>node ./test.js</code></pre>

** I ran into some problems while trying to test the solidity code, hence just deployed the code onto the goerli testnet. Following this, I ran into another set of problems instantiating the contract after deployment within test.js, hence this code is unable to provide the desired functionality as of now.
